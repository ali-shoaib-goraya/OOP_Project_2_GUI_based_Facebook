# GUI-based Facebook

Welcome to GUI-based Facebook, a semester project for an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course. This project aims to simulate a social media platform similar to Facebook, implemented using Python and the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). Additionally, data is stored using the Openpyxl library, which interacts with an Excel database file named "Facebook.xlsx".

## Environment Setup

Before running the application, ensure you have Python installed on your device along with the required libraries:
- Tkinter
- NumPy
- Openpyxl

## Running the Application

To run the application:
1. Download the "oop_project_3.py" and "Facebook.xlsx" files from the GitHub repository.
2. Place both files in the same folder for ease of access.
3. Execute the "oop_project_3.py" file.
4. Upon running, you'll be greeted with the GUI-based Facebook interface.
